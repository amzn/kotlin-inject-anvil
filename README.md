[![CI](https://github.com/amzn/kotlin-inject-anvil/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/amzn/kotlin-inject-anvil/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

[kotlin-inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject) is a compile-time dependency injection
framework for Kotlin Multiplatform similar to Dagger 2 for Java.
[Anvil](https://github.com/square/anvil) extends Dagger 2 to simplify dependency injection.

This project provides a similar feature set for the `kotlin-inject` framework. The extensions provided
by `kotlin-inject-anvil` allow you to contribute and automatically merge component interfaces without explicit
references in code.

```kotlin
@ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
interface AppIdComponent {
    @Provides
    fun provideAppId(): String = "demo app"
}

@Inject
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
@ContributesBinding(AppScope::class)
class RealAuthenticator : Authenticator

// The final kotlin-inject component.
//  see the section on "Usage > Merging" to understand
//  how AppComponentMerged is generated and must be used.
@Component
@MergeComponent(AppScope::class)
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
interface AppComponent : AppComponentMerged
```
From the above example code snippet:

* `AppIdComponent` will be made a super type of `AppComponent` and the
provider method is known to the object graph, so you can inject and use AppId anywhere.
* A binding for `RealAuthenticator` will be generated and the type `Authenticator` can safely be injected anywhere.
* Note that neither `AppIdComponent` nor `RealAuthenticator` need to be referenced anywhere else in your code.

## Setup

The project comes with a KSP plugin and a runtime module:
```groovy
dependencies {
    kspCommonMainMetadata "software.amazon.lastmile.kotlin.inject.anvil:compiler:$version"
    commonMainImplementation "software.amazon.lastmile.kotlin.inject.anvil:runtime:$version"

    // Optional module, but strongly suggested to import. It contains the
    // @SingleIn scope and @ForScope qualifier annotation together with the
    // AppScope::class marker.
    commonMainImplementation "software.amazon.lastmile.kotlin.inject.anvil:runtime-optional:$version"
}
```

You should setup kotlin-inject as described in the [official docs](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject).
For details how to setup KSP itself for multiplatform projects, see the
[official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-multiplatform.html).

#### Snapshot builds

To import snapshot builds use following repository:
```groovy
maven {
    url 'https://aws.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
}
```

## Usage

### Contributions

#### `@ContributesTo`

Component interfaces can be contributed using the `@ContributesTo` annotation:
```kotlin
@ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
interface AppIdComponent {
    @Provides
    fun provideAppId(): String = "demo app"
}
```
The scope `AppScope::class` tells `kotlin-inject-anvil` in which component to merge this
interface.

#### `@ContributesBinding`

`kotlin-inject` requires you to write
[binding / provider methods](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject#usage) in order to provide a
type in the object graph. Imagine this API:
```kotlin
interface Authenticator

class RealAuthenticator : Authenticator
```
Whenever you inject `Authenticator` the expectation is to receive an instance of
`RealAuthenticator`. With vanilla `kotlin-inject` you can achieve this with a provider
method:
```kotlin
@Inject
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
class RealAuthenticator : Authenticator

@ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
interface AuthenticatorComponent {
    @Provides
    fun provideAuthenticator(authenticator: RealAuthenticator): Authenticator = authenticator
}
```
Note that `@ContributesTo` is leveraged to automatically add the interface to the final component.

However, this is still too much code and can be simplified further with `@ContributesBinding`:
```kotlin
@Inject
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
@ContributesBinding(AppScope::class)
class RealAuthenticator : Authenticator
```
`@ContributesBinding` will generate a provider method similar to the one above and automatically
add it to the final component.

##### Multi-bindings

`@ContributesBinding` supports `Set` multi-bindings via its `multibinding` parameter.

```kotlin
@Inject
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
@ContributesBinding(AppScope::class, multibinding = true)
class LoggingInterceptor : Interceptor

@Component
@MergeComponent(AppScope::class)
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
abstract class AppComponent {
    // Will be contributed to this set multi-binding.
    abstract val interceptors: Set<Interceptor>
}
```

#### `@ContributesSubcomponent`

The `@ContributesSubcomponent` annotation allows you to define a subcomponent in any Gradle module,
but the final `@Component` will be generated when the parent component is merged.
```kotlin
@ContributesSubcomponent(LoggedInScope::class)
@SingleIn(LoggedInScope::class)
interface RendererComponent {

    @ContributesSubcomponent.Factory(AppScope::class)
    interface Factory {
        fun createRendererComponent(): RendererComponent
    }
}
```
For more details on usage of the annotation and behavior
[see the documentation](runtime/src/commonMain/kotlin/software/amazon/lastmile/kotlin/inject/anvil/ContributesSubcomponent.kt).

### Merging

With `kotlin-inject`, components are defined similar to the one below in order to instantiate your
object graph at runtime:
```kotlin
@Component
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
interface AppComponent
```
In order to pick up all contributions, you must add the `@MergeComponent` annotation:
```kotlin
@Component
@MergeComponent(AppScope::class)
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
interface AppComponent
```
This will generate a new interface `AppComponentMerged` in the same package as `AppComponent`.
This generated interface must be added as super type:
```kotlin
@Component
@MergeComponent(AppScope::class)
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
interface AppComponent : AppComponentMerged
```
With this setup any contribution is automatically merged. These steps have to be repeated for
every component in your project.

### Scopes

The plugin builds a connection between contributions and merged components through the scope
parameters. Scope classes are only markers and have no further meaning besides building a
connection between contributions and merging them. The class `AppScope` from the sample could
look like this:
```kotlin
object AppScope
```

Scope classes are independent of the `kotlin-inject`
[scopes](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject#scopes). It's still necessary to set a scope for
the `kotlin-inject` components or to make instances a singleton in a scope, e.g.
```kotlin
@Inject
@SingleIn(AppScope::class) // scope for kotlin-inject
@ContributesBinding(AppScope::class)
class RealAuthenticator : Authenticator

@Component
@MergeComponent(AppScope::class)
@SingleIn(AppScope::class) // scope for kotlin-inject
interface AppComponent
```

`kotlin-inject-anvil` provides the
[`@SingleIn` scope annotation](runtime-optional/src/commonMain/kotlin/software/amazon/lastmile/kotlin/inject/anvil/SingleIn.kt)
optionally by importing following module. We strongly recommend to use the annotation for
consistency.
```groovy
dependencies {
    commonMainImplementation "software.amazon.lastmile.kotlin.inject.anvil:runtime-optional:$version"
}
```

## Sample

A [sample project](sample) for Android and iOS is available.

## Advanced options

### Custom symbol processors

`kotlin-inject-anvil` is extensible and you can create your own annotations and KSP symbol
processors. In the generated code you can reference annotations from `kotlin-inject-anvil` itself
and build logic on top of them.

For example, assume this is your annotation:
```kotlin
@Target(CLASS)
annotation class MyCustomAnnotation
```

Your custom KSP symbol processor uses this annotation as trigger and generates following code:
```kotlin
@ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
interface MyCustomComponent {
    @Provides
    fun provideMyCustomType(): MyCustomType = ...
}
```
This generated component interface `MyCustomComponent` will be picked up by `kotlin-inject-anvil's`
symbol processors and contributed to the `AppScope` due to the `@ContributesTo` annotation.

**Custom annotations and symbol processors are very powerful and allow you to adjust
`kotlin-inject-anvil` to your needs and your codebase.**

There are two ways to indicate these to `kotlin-inject-anvil`. This is important for incremental
compilation and multi-round support.

1. **This is the preferred option**: Annotate your annotation with the `@ContributingAnnotation`
    marker and run `kotlin-inject-anvil`'s compiler over the project the annotation is hosted in.
    Adding the compiler as described in the [the setup](#setup) is important, otherwise the
    `@ContributingAnnotation` has no effect. With this the annotation is understood as a
    contributing annotation in all downstream usages of this annotation.
    ```kotlin
    @ContributingAnnotation // <--- add this!
    @Target(CLASS)
    annotation class MyCustomAnnotation
    ```
2. Alternatively, if you don't control the annotation or otherwise cannot use option 1, you can
    specify custom annotations via the `kotlin-inject-anvil-contributing-annotations` KSP option.
    This option value is a colon-delimited string whose values are the canonical class names of
    your custom annotations.
    ```kotlin
    ksp {
      arg("kotlin-inject-anvil-contributing-annotations", "com.example.MyCustomAnnotation")
    }
    ```

### Disabling processors

In some occasions the behavior of certain built-in symbol processors of `kotlin-inject-anvil`
doesn't meet expectations or should be changed. The recommendation in this case is to disable
the built-in processors and create your own. A processor can be disabled through KSP options, e.g.

```groovy
ksp {
    arg("software.amazon.lastmile.kotlin.inject.anvil.processor.ContributesBindingProcessor", "disabled")
}
```

The key of the option must match the fully qualified name of the symbol processor and the value
must be `disabled`. All other values will keep the processor enabled. All built-in symbol
processors are part of
[this package](compiler/src/main/kotlin/software/amazon/lastmile/kotlin/inject/anvil/processor).
